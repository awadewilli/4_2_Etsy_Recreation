PLEASE CONFIRM THAT YOUR ADDRESS ON ETSY IS 100% CORRECT BEFORE YOU SEND. I have been receiving far too many returned packages due to customers improperly inputting their addresses on Etsy and\/or Paypal. Please confirm your address on these sites BEFORE your purchase from my shop. If an item is returned to me I will do my best to contact customers but ultimately it is up to you to make sure that your address is correct as I cannot afford to keep paying for shipping to addresses that do not exist. Thank you for your cooperation.","policy_refunds":"Refunds will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. \r\n\r\nIf Items arrive damaged, buyer has 14 days to contact me about a replacement or refund. I will not be responsible for damaged goods that have been brought to my attention 14 days after delivery.\r\n\r\nOrders cannot be cancelled for a refund after their ship date. Orders cancelled before the ship date will take between 2-5 business days to process a refund back to the method of payment used for purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","policy_additional":"Contact information:\r\n\r\nIf you need to contact me please send me a message on Etsy.

If the matter is urgent, you can message me more than once and I&#39;ll do my best to answer as soon as I can.\r\n\r\nPLEASE DO NOT E-MAIL ME, I WILL NOT RESPOND.\r\n\r\nI get quite a lot of e-mails every day, and often times, e-mails from customers will get pushed into my spam folder, or I will miss them.

It also contains some 2nd Generation Pokemon (mainly because of the lack of letters to correspond with the 1st Generation).\n\nThese keyboard decals are customizable, so there is the opportunity to choose the Pokemon you wish to have. This will add that extra bit of personalization to it.\n\n==============================================\n\nCustomisation option works where &quot;0 to 4&quot; keys means you can choose either the standard set (which is the one that is picture) or choose a couple of keys to change (if you want to swap some of the pokemon \/ characters on some letters if you have different preferences). \n\nThe &quot;5 or more&quot; options works the same but with a small charge (if you want a lot changed to the set).\n\n==============================================\n\n\n\nThe decals will be created on adhesive paper and topped off with a clear protective finish, each key is its own sticker which you can remove from the set.\n\nPlease do message me for any inquiries and\/or questions, I&#39;ll happily answer them to the best of my ability! \n\nThese keyboards can also be created for European keyboards (the L shape &#39;return&#39; key). If you do have questions about this option, do message me and i shall arrange it all (as some Euro keyboards have different arrangements of keys \/ lettering).\n\nNOTE: If you do have any issues with the shipping address when making an order, please do message me right away after ordering the item, and let me know what the updated shipping address is (otherwise I&#39;ll end up shipping to the wrong address... no one wants that)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer: This is not a licensed product.

Thanks for being patient while my shop was closed!! c:\r\n\r\nHELLO I DRAW THINGS HI HOW ARE YOU? My name is Cari Corene, I currently live in Baltimore MD, I grew up in Anchorage AK and Yakima WA. So you&#39;ll see a lot of nature in these paintings despite me living in a decidedly urban environment currently.\r\n\r\n***********STALK THINGS AROUND THE INTERNET***********\r\nstoryofthedoor.com\r\nblix-it.deviantart.com\r\nfuraffinity.net\/user\/storyofthedoor\r\nstoryofthedoor.tumblr.com\r\ntwitter.com\/storyofthedoor\r\nfacebook.com\/storyofthedoor\r\n\r\n\r\n***********ALL ABOUT THE FRUSTRATING ART OF MAILING***********\r\n\r\nOrders ship from Baltimore, MD. \r\n\r\nPosters are mailed rolled up in tubes, this is great because I print on pretty decent paper! Most of my posters are on 100lb gloss paper which is pretty much what you&#39;d find if you bought a rolled up poster in a shop. \r\n\r\nPostcards are mailed flat, in a bag with a foam core backing, put inside a bubble mailer. \r\n\r\nBooks are mailed flat, in a bag, inside a bubble mailer. If it&#39;s a paperback book, it also comes with a foam core backing to help it survive the mailing process.\r\n\r\nUS ORDERS: All orders ship within 5 business days via first class parcel post. So if everything goes well with the postal system (if you&#39;re betting your life on the postal system being timely and efficient, please begin arranging your funeral) you should receive your order in about two weeks, hopefully less. \r\n\r\nRecently I&#39;ve begun using Etsy&#39;s Endicia ap for printing postage labels, so tracking numbers can be had. Please forgive me on the occassion I don&#39;t print a label through etsy, if it is a nonstandard order that I don&#39;t know the weight of, I just go to the post office and pay for shipping the old fashioned way. \r\n\r\nPriority mail can be requested, though it will cost extra. Please message me here on etsy in the event priority or faster is required. \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS (including Canada): When the postal system is running like a well oiled machine (rarely) and the weather is behaving (nearly never) and Mercury is high in the heavens and giving its blessing to the courier (hey it can&#39;t hurt) your parcel should take two weeks to ship once in the hands of the postal service and up to five business days (Saturday is not a business day) for your order to be sent off. So please allow at least three weeks for your order to arrive from the day you purchase. EVEN THEN, problems are known to occur - they should even be expected. Parcels are delayed or even lost far too frequently and as far as I know, once a parcel leaves the US, I am no longer able to purchase a tracking number for it. Endicia&#39;s tracking number just confirms that the parcel has left the US and entered the wild lands of your foreign country where realistically dragons can be expected to have eaten your parcel. For this reason, when something goes wrong, I always wait two months for the item to arrive or to be returned to me or to turn up in dragon droppings, whatever happens. So please, if you need something on a deadline and you&#39;re waiting on international shipping, I&#39;ll do my best, but just understand there&#39;s nearly nothing I can do once I mail the thing. \r\n\r\nCUSTOM ORDERS: also known as commission guidelines.\r\nI AM available for commission, but it&#39;s an operation that hinges on the complexity of what you want, if there is a deadline, and how busy I am at the time. \r\nMy work is completed in watercolor on Arches 140lb cold press paper.\r\nPrices begin at 70$ for an 8x10 inch painting of a single character in a simple environment. \r\nFrom there, the price may go up dependant on several variables such as additional characters, complex environments, and size of the painting. \r\nThe best thing to do is to note me about your request and we can talk about it from there.","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":"OH, YOU.

For international shipments, plan on at LEAST three weeks. I mean maybe in a magical fairy land your stuff might come sooner.

Our goal is to take your 3D rendering and turn it into a real life object. As a student I was always interested in 3D printing but was never able to expand into the hobby due to  the price of the printers. After a few years and different printers hitting the market the prices started coming down where they were more affordable. After printing items for friends and family an idea hit us. Why don&#39;t we expand and start printing for the general public who dont want to invest in a printer or just need an item printed for a project? This is where 3D-expressions came to light. We have had the pleasure to work with students that just needed a printed object for a project they were working on all the way to a small businesses  working on a prototype. Why let the price of a printer not allow you to express your creativity when we can print it for you? \r\n","policy_payment":"We accept Credit Card and PayPal.
